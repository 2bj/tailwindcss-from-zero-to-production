## Setup steps

First, install all the required dependencies with `npm`:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, start the Vite dev server with:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Production build with purged unused styles

To make a production build and trigger the purging of unused styles, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate production-ready assets in a `dist` directory.
